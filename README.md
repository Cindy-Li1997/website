<p align="center">The website of PingCAP. Powered by Gatsby ⚛️ and Rocket 🚀.</p>

## How to start

If you want to start to develop the PingCAP Website or you just want to contribute in one place.
The Gatsby.js [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is something you have to know.
Because of PingCAP Website's development is highly dependent on Gatsby.js.

Also, in order to build a flexible site, a server is essential.

We use [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) to build our restful APIs. So, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is also
the main tech in our development.

Make sure [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is installed. This is all we needed first.

Check it:

```sh
node -v
# v13.7.0

rustup -V
# rustup 1.21.1 (7832b2ebe 2019-12-20)
```

Also, we recommand you use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) as package manager, check it:

```sh
yarn -v
# 1.21.1
```
